<center><h1>Project 1 - BLS Unleaded Gas Price Data</h1></center>
<h2>The Question</h2>
<p>What political, economic, and social factors affect the price of gasoline in the United States?</p>
<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
<p><ol><li>In a recession gas prices will fall.</li>
<li>In times of U.S.  involvement in war gas prices rise at a quicker rate.</li>
<li>At times in the year when recreation is at its highest i.e. summer months, gas prices are at their highest.</li>
</ol>

<center><details>This data visualization supports part 1 and 2 of the hypothesis above.Observe in times of U.S. recession (shaded gray) the average gas price decreases.
Also during the Iraq war average gas prices generally increase over time.  In general, average gas prices are observed to increase over time (indicated by the blue best fit line).My visualization shows clear clarity of purpose in that it's
trying to relate U.S. recessions, and involvement in wars to decreases and increases in average gas prices respectively. The visualization displays a high density of data as it shows 38 years of average gas price data.  Lastly, my visualization allows
the viewer to interpret the data on multiple levels.  It is easy to observe trends during the war, and throughout different recessions as well as in-between these periods.  The axes are clearly labeled and the plot has great coherence.<summary>READ COMMENTARY ABOUT 1.0</details></summary></center>

<center><details>This data visualization supports part 1 and 2 of the hypothesis above.Observe in times of U.S. recession (shaded gray) the maximum gas price decreases.
Also during the Iraq war maximum gas prices generally increase over time.  In general, maximum gas prices are observed to increase over time (indicated by the blue best fit line).My visualization shows clear clarity of purpose in that it's
trying to relate U.S. recessions, and involvement in wars to decreases and increases in maximum gas prices respectively. The visualization displays a high density of data as it shows 38 years of maximum gas price data.  Lastly, my visualization allows
the viewer to interpret the data on multiple levels.  It is easy to observe trends during the war, and throughout different recessions as well as in-between these periods.  The axes are clearly labeled and the plot has great coherence.<summary>READ COMMENTARY ABOUT 2.0</details></summary></center>

<center><details>This data visualization supports part 3 of the hypothesis above.  These visualizations were constructed from data obtained and used in the previous visualization.
A count of the month corresponding to the maximum gas price was performed and displayed in a bar graph at first.Although, I thought the visual looked pretty ugly quite frankly,so I thought I would construct a word map with the months and corresponding occurances.  It supports the hypothesis in the fact that the summer months (June,July,March) are seen to be the largest.
This was a creative way to display this data without making it boring to the viewer.  Months are displayed with bigger font according to the number of occurances of the maximum gas price in that month over 38 years.  According to Tufte Visualization 3.1-3.2 would be excellent because it reveals the data.  Also, these visualizations make it easy to make comparisons.  Lastly, although fairly simple and intuitive the visualization still contains a high density of data.<summary>READ COMMENTARY ABOUT 3.1-3.2</details></summary></center>



<center><h1 font-size="20pt">Refuting the hypothesis</h1></center>
<center><h2>Visualization 4.1-4.2</h2></center>
<center><image src="Visualization4.1.png"></image></center>
<br><br>
<center><image src="Visualization4.2.png"></image></center>
<center><details>The following part of the visualizations (yellow region)refute parts 1 and 2 of the hypothesis together.  During this period both the average price of gas and maximum price of gas first increase then decrease.  This is contradictory as it's during a time of both U.S. recession and involvement in war.  The increase in maximum and average gas prices in this region violates part 1 of the hypothesis.  Also, the decrease in maximum and
average gas prices violates part 2 of the hypothesis as well.  This calls these parts of the hypothesis into question.  According to Tufte the visualization would be excellent as it displays a high density of data.  Also, it is easy to make comparisons between gas price and years.  Lastly, the plot has great coherence, and is distortion free.<summary>READ COMMENTARY ABOUT 4.1-4.2</details></summary></center>
